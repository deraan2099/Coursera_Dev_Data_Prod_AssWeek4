This app was realized in order to fulfill the Week 4 Peer Graded Assignment for the Coursera Developing Data Product course.

The app use the mtcars dataset to calculate a ranking of cars, starting from those that consumes less fuel. The mtcars dataset is slightly modified in order to consider liters instead of gallons and kilometers instead of miles.

The ranking is customized according to the user's preferences about the car he/she wants to use. For example: the user can select if he/she wants a car with either manual or automatic transmission, number of cylinders, number of gears, etc. The user can select these options and look at the results.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available GitHub.
